possessive # root-preposition[-like/as if][-plural][-only/just]
The following sound changes take place (within and across words):
yk → ky
k → g | N_ [N = m, ŋ, n]
k → ŋg | s_

t → d | N_
t → nd | s_

p → b | N_
p → mb | s_

c → nc | s_

The vocabulary is as follows:
(i) Possessives

2. The structure of a verb form in Menominee is:
(person prefix) + A + B + (person suffix)
which can be translated as "X does A_verb, B_adverb" or as "X does B_verb, A_adverb".

The vocabulary is as follows:
(i) Personal prefixes:
I = ne-
we_{1+2} = ke-
he = ɸ-
(ii) A
A    adverb  verb
kaw  -       fell/lay flat
kāw  -       fall/lie down
pīt  here    come/bring
kēsk through break through
pāhk off     open
kEt  out     pry out/take out
wǣp  -       begin
taw  hole    -
wack around  -
(iii) B
B      adverb   verb
aha    by tool  -
Ena    by hand  pass
Esa    -        cut
ānæhkæ digging  dig
ahtæ   in mouth eat
ohnæ   walking  walk
āhpe   laughing laugh
eqta   ɸ        ɸ     [placeholder]
(iv) Personal suffixes
For ohnæ, āhpe, and eqta:
(I) : -m
(we_{1+2}) : -q
(he) : -w
For other B:
(I) : -n
(we_{1+2}) : -q
(he) : -m

note: the verb coming after "begin" is considered an adverb and expressed by B.

After constructing the word, the following sound changes take place:
1. If the first syllable is ke- or ne-, the second syllable becomes long ( ̄).
2. If the second syllable is E and:
the first contains a, ā or E, then the second syllable becomes Ē and the first syllable loses  ̄ if it has it.
3. If the first two syllables are still both short, the second becomes long ( ̄).
4. The ending -aq becomes -æq.
