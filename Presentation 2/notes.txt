2 # Brain and Language
- neurolinguistics (largely experimental)
a. The Human Brain
   - most complex organ
   - contralateral fn
   - localisation: Joseph Gall
   - acquired aphasia: Broca's area, Wenicke's area -> lateralisation
   - selective impairment; related to location
   - Broca's aphasia: word-finding, syntax, inflections, fn words
   - Wernicke's aphasia: semantic incoherence, naming, lexical errors
   - words are an organised network of connexns
   - anomic aphasia: word-finding
   - auditory cortex processes SLs too; similar breakdowns in signers
   - no connection to nonlinguistic gestures (same articulators)
   - other cognitive faculties of aphasics intact
   - acquired dyslexia: two types, deep and surface
   - deep: semantically related words retrieved; fn words difficult
   - surface: need to sound out to access
   - split-brain: corpus callosum severed
   - right hand: name, describe; left hand: use but not name
   - written material from right eye can't be read aloud
   - neurolinguistic evidence for linguistic categories (eg phonemes)
   - left hem. sensitive to grammatical structure even w/o meaning
   - syntax --/-- semantics
   - further moved objects => longer response times
   - difference types of ungramm. have diff. signatures
   - syntactic processing is reflex-like
b. The Modular Mind: Dissociations of Language and Cognition
   - linguistic savants: language fine but no nonlinguistic abilities
   - linguistic ability <=/= general intelligence
   - SLI: no cognitive/perceptual deficits; only lang acq
   - certain grammatical structures might be more "vulnerable"
   - chromosomal anomalies show genetic basis of devpt
   - SLI is genetic
