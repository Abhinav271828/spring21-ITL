## Observations
1. (Problem 1) In question 1.3, the English words don't have the endings of the Greek words (_-a_, _-os_ and _-on_ in transcription), so maybe these endings are variable, i.e., the words don't always end with these letters depending on context.  
2. (Problem 2) If a word ends in two consonants, and the next word starts with a consonant, the last consonant of the first word is frequently not pronounced. For example, _can't think_ becomes [kɑːn̪θɪŋk]. Further, the last remaining consonant's place of articulation changes to match that of the first consonant in the next word; for example, _one bike_ is pronounced as [wʌmbaɪk].  
3. (Problem 2) One peculiarity of the South British accent is the occurrence of [əʊ], where in Indian English [oː] occurs, and of [eɪ] where in Indian English [eː] occurs. Examples include _go_ [gəʊ] and _cake_ [keɪk].  
4. (Problem 3) The system of Visible Speech is clearly phonetic and follows a one-one sound-symbol correspondence, and so could be said to illustrate the feature of duality of patterning. It is also of note that even though it is phonetic, it is structurally different from Indian language scripts, since the vowel symbols remain distinct from the consonant ones.
